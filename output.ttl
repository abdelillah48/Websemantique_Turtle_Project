It will be almost impossible to replicate this spice exactly as the orginal can contain up to 50 spices &amp; very exotic ones such as rose petals, lavender, nigella &amp; grains of paradise, but I have tried to incorporoate all the Traditional elements of this exotic mix, with spices that will be easily &amp; readily available in most countries! \r
Store it in an airtight &amp; preferably dark tin/container, and in a cool &amp; dry place; depending on the freshness of the spices you have used &amp; your storage conditions, this should last for up to 6 months.\r
You can buy this as Yellow or Red Ras-el-Hanout, I have made up the yellow version - it's the one I mainly use in my cooking!\r
Please note - this is NOT a hot spice mix - but an aromatic &amp; very fragrant one! If you want to &quot;perk&quot; it up a bit, add more cayenne pepper.\r
I have added optional ingredients - spices which may be difficult to obtain, but if you have them, add them!!\r
Would make a great gift too!\r

Weve adapted cookbook author Paula Wolferts quick method, our favorite, and made it even faster by blanching the lemons first. The rind of a preserved lemon is a common ingredient in Moroccan dishes; we also love it in all kinds of soups, stews, and salads and as a low-fat alternative to olives. Save the pulp for Bloody Marys or anything else enlivened by a little lemon juice and salt.\r
\r
Tip: There are some recipes for preserving lemons that call for you to slice the lemon, but not all the way through and pack it with the salt. This is not one of them. You will need a VERY sharp knife to cut the Meyer's into wedges, as they will be especially soft after blanching them. And you want to get rid of the seeds. No preserving of the seeds. Use a flexible cutting board to cut them on so you can save some of the juice that collects from cutting them. You can use some of that to help with the packing of the lemons.\r
\r
This recipe is adapted from epicurious.com.\r

This version is based on Paula Wolfert's, the authority on Moroccan cooking (outside of Morocco).  Ras el hanout roughly translates to &quot;head of the shop&quot; and according to sources on the internet (and we all know that everything we read on the internet is true ;-)) the authentic versions can contain up to 100 ingredients, among them Spanish Fly and hashish. My version contains only ingredients that I am able to find at my nearby neighborhood ethnic markets; hence, no hashish or Spanish Fly. Since I have been unable to find certain types of peppers included in some recipes, I use dried chipotle peppers.  No, it is not Morrocan; but it adds a hint of smokiness, on top of the smoked paprika, which I add later during the actual food prep. Although some versions of Ras include paprika, I feel that I have more control over the flavor if it is added later.  Then I use Spanish smoked paprika (De la Vera)." ;
